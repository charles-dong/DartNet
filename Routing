Lecture Routing Algorithm

1 Initialization: 
2 S = {u} 
3 for all nodes v 
4 if v adjacent to u { 
5 D(v) = c(u,v) 
6 else D(v) = ∞ 
7 
8 Loop 
9 find w not in S with the smallest D(w) 
10 add w to S 
11 update D(v) for all v adjacent to w and not in S: 
12 D(v) = min{D(v), D(w) + c(w,v)} 
13 until all nodes in S



Book's Routing Algorithm

At each node, x:

Initialization:

for all destinations y in N:
	Dx(y) = c(x,y) /* if y is not a neighbor then c(x,y) = ∞ */
for each neighbor w
	Dw(y) = ? for all destinations y in N
for each neighbor w
	send distance vector Dx = [Dx(y): y in N] to w

loop
	wait (until I see a link cost change to some neighbor w or 
		until I receive a distance vector from some neighbor w)
	for each y in N:
		Dx(y) = minv{c(x,v) + Dv(y)}
	if Dx(y) changed for any destination y
		send distance vector Dx = [Dx(y): y in N] to all neighbors
forever
